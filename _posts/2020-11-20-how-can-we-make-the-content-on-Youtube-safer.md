<!-- 
This is a PHP snippet:

```php
<?php
    echo 'Hello, World!';
?>
``` -->

<!-- This is a JavaScript snippet:

```js
const add = (a, b) => a + b
const minus = (a, b) => a - b

console.log(add(100,200))  // 300
console.log(minus(100,200))  // -100
```

This is a Python snippet:

```python
def say_hello():
    print("hello world!")

say_hello()   // "hello world!"
``` -->
